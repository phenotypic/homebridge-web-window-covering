## API Interfacing

Your API should be able to:

1. Return JSON information when it receives `/status`:
```
{
    "positionState": INT_VALUE,
    "currentPosition": INT_VALUE,
    "targetPosition": INT_VALUE
}
```

2. Open/close the garage when it receives:
```
/targetPosition/INT_VALUE_0_TO_100
```

3. Update `currentPosition` as it opens/closes by messaging the listen server:
```
/currentPosition/INT_VALUE_0_TO_100
```

4. Update `positionState` as it opens/closes by messaging the listen server:
```
/positionState/INT_VALUE_0_TO_2
```

5. Update `targetPosition` following a manual override by messaging the listen server:
```
/targetPosition/INT_VALUE_0_TO_100
```

6. Update `obstructionDetected` when an obstruction is detected by messaging the listen server (should notify `0` after obstruction moves unless `autoReset` is enabled):
```
/obstructionDetected/INT_VALUE_0_TO_1
```

## PositionState Key

| Number | Name |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Opening |
| `1` | Closing |
| `2` | Open/Closed |
